# Barcode_Detector
A computer vision pipeline that processes input images to detect, isolate, and decode barcodes using the Code 11 symbology. It applies preprocessing steps like grayscale conversion, noise reduction, gradient analysis, and morphological operations to locate the barcode region, then extracts the barcode signal and decodes it using a custom Code 11 implementation.
